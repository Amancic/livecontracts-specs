# Identity

An identity within the event chain. The identity is used for authentication and authorization. An identity is not a
user, a user has an identity for each event chain it's participating in.

## Schemas

* [Identity](#identity-schema)
* [Privilege](#privilege-schema)

## Registration

The first event on the event chain MUST be an identity. This event enables the user or organization to add subsequent
events on the chain. This is the initiator of the chain.

This initial identity can start adding other identities on the chain. If it knows the public key(s) of, it can simply
add them and notify the user about this new chain. If the public key is unknown a new key pair may be generated.

### Authentication

Possibly the new identity might need to go to an authentication process before it can participate in a process, get
write access to a contract, etc. In that case the system of the initiator is responsible of granting additional
privileges at the end of the authentication process.

### Removal

Any identity that can overwrite other identities of the event chain, may remove that identity by clearing the
`node`, `encryptkey` and `signkeys` property. That way the user no longer receives new events and is unable to fetch
the chain.

Note that it's not possible to force a node or user to delete an event chain that has already been received.

### Identity for invitation to the event chain

## Identity schema

[JSON Schema](schema.json#)

### $schema

The Live Contracts Identity [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org) URI that describes the JSON structure of the identity.
To point to this version of the specification use `"$schema": "http://specs.livecontracts.io/draft-01/02-identity/schema.json#"`.

### id

A unique identifier for the identity within the event chain using UUID-4.

### name

The name of the user that has taken this identity.

### email

The email address of the user that has taken this identity.

### info

The `info` object contains additional information about the user. The `$schema` property defines the other properties
of `info`. The schema for this is not defined by the Live Contracts specification. Having the user info in a schema that
both systems understands means that a user can skip steps where it's asked to identity itself. The info may also hold
properties that can be used for authentication.

### node

The domain name of the LegalThings One node that the user is running the chain on. Additions to the chain are not
broadcasted, but send to the nodes of the active identities extracted from the event chain.

### privileges

A list of [privileges](#privilege).

### signkeys

The public keys that the identity uses for signing events. It's an object where the key is the type.

Common types are `user` and `system`. The `user` key is kept client side, so you can be sure that the user takes that
action. The system key doesn't belong to the user but to the node the user is running on. It can be specified for an
automated step.

```json
{
    "user": "8MeRTc26xZqPmQ3Q29RJBwtgtXDPwR7P9QNArymjPLVQ",
    "system": "FA2CiSAWUEANTxcffctxm8XQfTugZv7VX5C1Qb59vbxj"
}
```

### encryptkey

The public key for encrypting data for the identity. The private encrypt key is typically hold and kept secret by the
node which is responsible for encrypting and decrypting events.

## Privilege schema

[JSON Schema](schema.json#privilege)

A privilege grant the identity to add one type events to the event chain.

### schema

A live contracts schema URI. This determines the type of events that may be added to the event chain.

### id

Set the `id` if the privilege only applies to a specific projection like a process or a contract.

### only

When projecting an item from an event, filter the body so it only contains these properties. Properties listed here
are ignored. This doesn't go more than one level deep.

### not

When projecting an item from an event, filter the body so it does not contains these properties. Properties note listed
here are ignored. This doesn't go more than one level deep.

### signkey

If specified, only this type / these types of sign keys may be used to sign the event.
