# Cryptography

Live Contracts uses the `SHA256` to create a cryptographic hashes. The `Blake2b256` and `Keccak256` hashing algorithms
are used for creating public/secret key pairs. The `ED25519` scheme is applied to create and verify signatures. `X25519`
is used to for asymmetric encryption. For symmetric encrypt use `AES256` in Galois/Counter Mode (gcm). `Base58` is used
to create the string from of bytes.

If you want to create an application, you should find the implementation of these algorithms on your programming
language.

## Base58

In order to ease human readable, all arrays of bytes in the project are encoded by [Base58 algorithm with Bitcoin
alphabet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding).

#### Example 
The string `teststring` are coded into the bytes `[5, 83, 9, -20, 82, -65, 120, -11]`. The bytes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` are
coded into the string `7bWpTW`.

## Asymmetric encryption

Live Contracts uses `Curve25519` (Montgomery form) for encryption (`X25519`) and signing (`ED25519`).

This method is similar to the one used by the [Waves platform](https://wavesplatform.com/). You can calculate a Waves
wallet address from the `X25519` key.

### Creating a private key from a seed

A seed string is a representation of entropy, from which you can re-create deterministically all the private keys for
an account. It should be long enough so that the probability of selection was a unrealistic negligible.

For ease of memorization the LegalThings One front-end uses [Brainwallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet), to
ensure that the seed is made up of words, that is easy to write down or remember. The app takes the UTF-8 bytes of
the string and uses them to create keys and addresses.

For example, seed string `manage manual recall harvest series desert melt police rose hollow moral pledge kitten
position add` after reading as UTF-8 bytes and encoding them to Base58 string are coded as
`xrv7ffrv2A9g5pKSxt7gHGrPYJgRnsEMDyc4G7srbia6PhXYLDKVsDxnqsEqhAVbbko7N1tDyaSrWCZBoMyvdwaFNjWNPjKdcoZTKbKr2Vw9vu53Uf4dYpyWCyvfPbRskHfgt9q`.

A seed string is involved with the creation of private keys. When creating a private key using the LegalThings One
front-end, the seed is prepended with a 'nonce' field of 4 bytes (big-endian representation). This initially has a value
of 0 and increases every time you create the new account. We use this array of bytes for calculate hash
`keccak256(blake2b256(bytes))`. This resulting array of bytes we call `account seed`, from it you can generate a private
and public key pair. This is then converted to a public and private key pair for the `Curve25519` algorithm.

*NOTE: Not all random 32 bytes can be used as private keys (but any bytes of any size can be a seed). The signature
scheme for the ED25519 introduces restrictions on the keys, so create the keys only through the methods of the
Curve25519 libraries and be sure to make a test of the ability to sign data with a private key and then check it with a
public key, however obvious this test might seem.*

In JavaScript, use the [Javascript client for LegalThings One](https://github.com/legalthings/lto-api).

There are valid Curve25519 realizations for different languages:
- [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.sodium.php)
- [Java](https://github.com/signalapp/curve25519-java/)
- [C](https://github.com/signalapp/curve25519-java/tree/master/android/jni)
- [Python](https://github.com/tgalal/python-axolotl-curve25519)
- [JS](https://github.com/wavesplatform/curve25519-js)

Also some `Curve25519` libraries (as the one used in our project) have the `SHA256` hashing integrated, some not
(such as most of c/c++/python libraries), so you may need to apply it manually. Note that private key is clamped, so not
any random 32 bytes can be a valid private key.

### Signing

**ED25519** is used for all the signatures in the project.

The process is as follows: create the message for signing (for an event, you can find it
[here](http://schema.livecontract.io/event-chain/#signature)), then create a signature from this message using the
private key.

Validation of signature requires the signature, the message and the public key.

Do not forget that there are many valid (not unique!) signatures for a one message. Also you should should not rely on
any information before the hash and/or signature are checked.

### Encryption

Live Contracts uses `X25519` to encrypt data. This is a public key encryption schema, where the public key is used to
encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt data.

Unfortunately most of embedded cryptography devices and libraries don't support X25519 keys. However there are the
libraries with conversion functions from ED25519 keys to X25519 (Curve25519) like
[libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/advanced/ed25519-curve25519.html).

[Here is an example of conversion using libsodium for ED25519 keys and signature to Curve25519](https://gist.github.com/Tolsi/d64fcb09db4ead75e5eeeab445284c93).

## Symmetric encrypt

`AES256` in Galois/Counter Mode (gcm) may also be used to encrypt data. This is a symmetric encryption schema, where the
same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.

Symmetric encryption SHOULD be applied when linking to external content in a template, document or comment.

You SHOULD always generate a new random key when using symmetric encryption. While the key SHOULD NOT be shared with
third parties, anybody that has a copy of the key can still do so.
