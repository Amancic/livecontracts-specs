# Form

form and fields can be rendered directly to HTML or to JavaScript enabled widgets as with Angular or React.

### Full example

[See the full example with all field types](example.json)

## Form schema

[JSON Schema](schema.json#)

### $schema

The Live Contracts Event chain [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org) URI that describes the JSON structure of the event
chain. To point to this version of the specification use
`"$schema": "http://specs.livecontracts.io/draft-01/01-event-chain/schema.json#"`.

### id

A URI as a globally unique identifier for the form. This is typically an [LTRI](../00-ltri/)
using a random UUID-4; `lt:/forms/<uuid-4>`.

### name

The name of the form.

### locale

The ISO-639 locale for the form. This determines the input format for numbers and dates.

### definition

The array of [steps](#step-schema).

## apply_in

A [JMESPath query](http://jmespath.org/) to transform data which is offered as input to the form.

## apply_out

A [JMESPath query](http://jmespath.org/) to transform data when outputted from the form.

## Step schema

A form has steps which groups the fields. Steps can be shown one at a time, like a wizard, or all at once.

[JSON Schema](schema.json#step)

### label

Step label or header shown above the fields of the step.

### group

Variable name to group fields. If specified, the step creates an object as variable. All fields of the step are
properties of the object.

### repeat

A number, field reference or expression determining how often the step is repeated when filling out the form.

If the step is repeated, specifying a `group` is required. In that case the step creates an of objects instead.

### anchor

If the form is associated to a template, enter a paragraph number or anchor name. The UI SHOULD scroll to the anchor
when this step is focused.

### helptext

HTML that is shown when filling out this step. Typically this is shown in place of the preview.

### helptip

A short text with instructions that is shown for the step.

### conditions

An expression to show / hide the step. If the expression validates to `true` the step is show, when `false` the step
MUST be hidden.

If the step is hidden, the variables connected to the fields in this step remain undefined.

### fields

An array of field definitions. Each field is structured according to the schema of a specific field type.

## Common field properties

A number of properties are shared across many of the field types.

### $schema

The JSON Schema of the field. This identifies the field type.

### label

A label that is shown with the field.

The label is rendered as [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) and may reference data variables.

### name

The variable name for the field. When filling out the form, a variable with this name will contain the typed in value.
This is also the name used for the result data.

You may use a dot to group data (eg `client.name`). An object is automatically created in this case. This can be used in
addition or instead of `group` in a step.

### default

The default value of the field.

### helptext

Help text attached to the field as HTML. This help text may contain specific instructions about filling out this field.

The help text is rendered as [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) and may reference data variables.

### conditions

An expression to show / hide the step. If the expression validates to `true` the step is show, when `false` the step
MUST be hidden.

If the field is hidden, the variable connected to the fields remains undefined. You MAY use the same `name` for
different fields, as long as only one is shown at any time.

### required

Boolean value to set the field as required or not. If a required field is not filled out, it will result in a validation
error.

### min

The minimal value of the field. A value lower than this results in a validation error.

### maximum

The minimal value of the field. A value higher than this results in a validation error.

### validation

An expression that is used for validation. This expression may reference any field of the form.

## Text schema

[JSON Schema](schema.json#text)

    <input type="text">
